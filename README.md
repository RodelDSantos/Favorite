Summary: My favorite video game: Old School Runescape aka OSRS. OSRS is a massively multiplayer online styled game that millions of other players have played. There are currently an average of 100,000 people playing on a typical day. OSRS released in 2013 but has other versions of it such as Runecape 3. A lot of players loved the nostalgic game that was released in the early 2000's and that is why they released OSRS. This offer the players to revisit the early stages of the game and update the game based on player polls. I have been playing off and on since 2013 and I have still yet to max my account with all the 23 skills that it offers. ðŸ˜‚

3 Reasons Why I like OSRS: I play the game because it makes me feel the nostalogic feelings as I felt as a child. OSRS has hundreds or even thousands of hours of gameplay. This allows the user to have endless amount of game play. The expected amount of years to max a character takes an average of 8-9 years! Lastly one of the reasons why I like OSRS is because of the player vs monster. I am able to defeat incredible bosses that require mechanics and expensive gear that I worked countless numnber of hours on. Your gear shows your worth! Some of the basic rules for Old School RuneScape are; respect the game and other players, no cheating or botting, and no real world trading.
